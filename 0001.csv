Bone, Bone, Bone, 
Bone, Bone, Bone, 
Bone, Bone, Bone, 
So tell me what ya gonna do
When there ain't nowhere to run
When judgement comes for you
When judgement comes for you
So tell me what ya gonna do
There ainâ€˜t no place to hide
When judgement comes for you
Cos itâ€˜s gonna come for you

See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads

So why you gotta go and pray
You're gonna make it some day
You got a job
So why you want a raise
Why you wanna act tough
Why can't you play
This whole fame thing
Just comes one of these days
And when it comes
You'll be one of a kind
But before this
Keep all this in your mind
Cos I will hold you
To the end of the line
Want all this
You'll be mad to decline

So what you gonna do 
When everyday's the same
Try and do this shush 
Just for a glimpse of fame
Didn't mean to do it 
Just put yourself to shame
Didn't want to kill her
Just tryin' to play the game
When you reach the crossroads
Where you gonna go
Go with your conscience
Just let your feelings flow
Life's up life's down
But things can turn around
Innocent or guilty
You will soon be found

Mmmm and we pray
And we pray
And we pray
And we pray
Everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday
And we pray
And we pray
And we pray
And we pray
Still we lay
Still we lay

(So you won't be lonely)

(See you at the crossroads
See you, see you
See you at the crossroads)


Who's that get off the train
Avirex jacket
With the poor with that rain
Why take that man's chain
No more trouble made

Livin' on the streets everyday 
So lame
People walking past
Looking at you in shame
But they don't really care
Who's the one to blame
You're gonna take the wrong turn
You're gonna lose the game
You know its not you're fault 
That life turned this way
But people don't care
Don't hear what you say
And the way it is now
Is the way it's gonna stay
There's no choice left but to hope and pray


(So you won't be lonely)

(See you at the crossroads
See you, see you
See you at the crossroads)",$$x

[Chevy P aka Smoke]
Its ya boy Chevy P babe...
Listen

[Chevy P aka Smoke]
I remember as a kid back.. in the days
I got picked on kicked at... shit on spit at
Get gone get back (gone Smoke) get away
Havin a dark pigmentation was hard then to make friends
Felt like God didn't take his time with me
He musta made me late night tired and sleepy
Cause life wasn't easy they dogged me
Said that I was so dark the bet I could sweat coffee
And peepee sweet tea and spit oil
Say when ashy I lotion down in Armor All
Made me feel like a loser really lame
Because of my complexion nobody would include me in games
Not even tag never ""it"" nobody would touch me
Nope no girlfriends cause shawties thought I was ugly
Through all the jokes and laughs pokes and stabs blows and jabs
Hopin sad mopin mad before the scabs nobody told me that...

[Hook w/ 2Pac sample from ""Keep Ya Head Up""]
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
(this song is to all the dark skinned)
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say
The blacker the berry t-the blacker the berry
The blacker the blacker the blacker the blacker

[Chevy P aka Smoke]
I ain't have Marvin Gaye to sing to me
And make me feel like black was the thing to be
Until Big Daddy Kane I was so glad he came
Made me feel good about bein black again cause
We was at the bottom of the market
(Al B.) made (Sure) it was a problem to be dark skinned
Until (Wesley Sniped) him
In with the darkies out with the light skinned
Now we got Tyrese Taye and Tyson
Mekhi Phife in every movie ya likin
Blade he remind me of a modern day Panther
While Batman (hides behind a mask) like a (Klansman)
We have to achieve... ('Caine's killin us)
Like it killed the second son of Adam and Eve
Ya palm is white and spread fist still black and tightly now
Slappin five was cool but rather ya ball ya fist and give me pound
'cause

[Hook]

[Chevy P aka Smoke]
Tiger Woods say he ain't black... whatever
They say Michael Jackson ain't white... whatever
And Venus and Serena done beat mo white girls
Than O.J. and Rick James put together
Now Michael Vick's the new black hero
Bet John Madden ain't see it comin
(saw a quarterback as a negro)
Jordan he can't hide it he look like an African Tribal leader
If you can lighten him then you can brighten me up
Now don't get me wrong and think I'm prejudiced
Listenin to this song.. I'm not racist
As a matter of fact shout out to Jamie Lori and Chad
My white friends from Lee County to Bladecliff
Just bein dark is it what's like bein white in the audience
At a black comedy show I
Was guaranteed to get cracked on and joked out
Now this ugly duckling is a swan I know now

[Hook]

It's the F-be-I

[Verse 1 - Shawn Jay]
Now what you gon go do after church
Hit the mall snatch a hat grab a shirt
Wash the 'Lac wax the 'Vert clean the truck
We finna ball stash the strap and pass the purp
Me and my dogs ridin old school whippin in the back street
Lookin for the tickets on the strip like Zaxby's
Now them hoes is out boy believe it
When they be cute I have to stop em
Love myself some Georgia Peaches and daisy dukes wit apple bottoms
Police tell us leave we wanna chill
Free plate took the cooked meat on the girll
Shawty gon choose when she see me lean
Make the draws drop fast like my TV screens
So high think I might overdose 
Behind tint gettin bent tint smokin dro

The paint on the Chevy drippin like a jheri curl
We covered in candy on mustard and mayonnaise
We ride 30 spokes while the others on fan blades
We firin up the dro bumpin Frankie and Maze
Top down sittin low chillin under the shade
Watchin cars cruisin I should walk wit jewelry
The broads they choosin baby how you doin
Some barbequin playin cards they losin
?? get stupid then they start to shootin
Patron in the trunk wit the coolers of brewskis
We dogs on the hunt for thick hips and the booty
Fresh dressed like a million bucks
You see me I keep cologne Red Monkey jeans cuffs
Then I step out the car then I thought ""oh no""
I got back in I forgot my one zone

[Hook - Chevy P aka Smoke]
Rollin slow on molten 30's gold over my pearlies
See a lady I get flirty this is how we do it in the dirty

It's a ghetto fashion show who came the freshest

[Verse 1 - Chevy P aka Smoke]
Nowadays girls and boys wanna lick me
Her put her tongue on me him pull his gun onme
I won't let 'em get me I stay strapped
In case I try to stick her and he try to stick me
So I'm... packin my magnums
In case I gotta blast one
The only time I'm leakin out my head is when I'm sweatin
You ain't gon have me layin dead in my Chevy
I worked hard for my rings shades and bracelet
He left dead came to take it brains eraded
He bled red stains in pavement
His crane split slain he lay stiff.. think about it...
Before you make that move this be ya warning
He's ready to be squeezed like an orange
Bullets penetrate ya (bleedin like menustration)
I'ma empty out (more shells) than in (Run-D.M.C.'s) closet

[Hook - Chevy P aka Smoke]
I got my..
Pistol grip on the side of me
And ain't no bitch gon catch me slippin cause it ride wit me
I got my heater in my lap I'm squeezin on my strap
Try me you'll bleed
I let it rip empty the clip
Run up you'll die in these streets

[Verse 2 - Shawn Jay]
Shawn Jay known to rip a instrumental
You can bleed like I wrote pen but this one in a pencil
Starvin artist I paint a picture
Way I (touch O's) everyday for me like a game of (Twister)
Achievement say I'm a legend
Ghetto bitches be wishin they could spend a day in my presence
I'm stackin plenty dough I stay on cloud nine
Like 2Pac in ""I Ain't Mad At Cha"" video
Now start with me I'ma target ya click
The (Scope) I got ain't the type you (gargle and spit)
It sit on top of the fifth small semi's and 4-4s
Heat'll leave a enemy so cold
Thirty feet away with one eye squinted
You look like the man on the fuckin Public Enemy logo
First nigga start shit
Watch the tech spray a flame like a airbrush artist

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Chevy P aka Smoke]
Shiit.. I'll die for mine you ain't gon take it wit ease
You better go (jack monterey) for his (cheese)
You run up on me in my 745 Beamer
You catch 7 shots from my 45... eat em
In my lap is where the heat's kept
I ride strapped and I ain't talkin about no seatbelts
When I pull shoot and blast I'm aimin at cha head
To make sure you dead you better wear a bullsetproof mask

[Shawn Jay]
It's no secret I keep the nina
It sit soul/sole food like sneaker cleaner
I sell those pies I tell no lies
Cookies same size as Tickle-Me-Elmo's eyes
You don't know no dirt
I'll put a hole through the head of the horse in ya polo shirt
Like a nerd in a science fair hang around projects
Bluck! when I stop by

[Hook - 2X]

[Verse 1:]
You supposed to be that nigga,
You got a dime on ya side,
(So why you foollin? with me ?),
Listen I ain?t bein? reckless
I?m just tryin? to get this record straight,
(Look what ya doin? to me),
You got me contemplatin? thinkin? maybe,
I should come check you out in that suite,
Pop open some yellow bottles undress me like a model,
Then maybe we could wrinkle the sheets,

But then I know she?ll always be the one you,
Take out show around,
But you continue to hold on to me so,
(Why ?),
Would you think that I could settle for less it?s just
One night no I,
Don?t wanna wake up the next mornin? askin?,
(Why ?)

[Chorus:]
So what I need to know is,
If you?re foollin?,
Only foollin?,
All I asked is (Why ?),
If you?re foollin?,
Only foollin?,
All I asked is (Why ?)

[Verse 2:]
Now the media?s gossipin? pinnin? me in magazines,
Sayin? I was the one,

Comparin? us to that Brad, Jen and Angelina affair,
Look baby I ain?t the one,
What I?m sayin? is,
I ain?t tryin? to go for that,
(No),
Look I can?t go for that,
(No),
You need find out where your home is at,
And turn the key and range rove it back,

You didn?t want me then so tell me what made,
You changed ya mind
'cause ain?t a thing don?t changed about me,
Tell me (Why ?),
'cause when you say you love me it?s when I?m with
Someone else I can?t help,
You to continue foollin? me,
So tell me (Why ?),

[Chorus:]
So what I?m tryna? say is
If you?re foollin?,

All I asked is (Why ?),
If you?re foollin?,

[Verse 1]

Drive fast, don't crash, make your money, make it last 
Hang tight, kick back, prepare yourself for the attack- 
Buy low, sell high, take your pills, tell your lies 
Fake your tan, wear a tie ? 
Go to the gym you'll never die! 

[Bridge]

And that's the way to go! 
And that's the way to go ? to go! 

[Chorus]

Fake it baby - They won't even know! 
You can make it ? 
'cause everybody knows that that's the way to go 

[Verse 2]

Tune in, drop out, raise your voice, never shout 
Find your true love on the couch, this is what it's all about 
Change your face, keep your name, keep it real don't play the game 
? don't you know they're all the same ? don't you know they're all the same? 

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Dig deep, fly low, celebrate a tv show 
Raise the stakes, drop the pressure, happiness you'll never measure 
Bite your tongue, pay the man, time to start your five year plan 
Holiday in Vietnam, then blow a kiss to Uncle Sam. 

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Willie]
Life is such a crazy thing
It's never really what it seems 
Cause first we were chillin
Now I'm catchin feelins 
Can you tell me what this means
I'm going through my voicemail 
And I'm saving every message you sent 
I'm tryna reading between the lines 
To see if there was somethin' I missed 

[Q]
All of a sudden, my vision became so clear. 
Everything I needed was right here, 
Before me (before me) 
So pressed to let you know 
Just how you make me feel 
Never had a feeling that's so real 
Control me (and I'm ready, girl I'm ready) 

[Chorus]
Don't wanna play no games, 
I want you exclusive, 
Baby, we should just do this, 
With the feeling's so strong, 
How can we go wrong 
No games, I want you exclusive 
There's no more excuses 
The feelings so right 
I want you girl, I need you girl 

[Brian A.]
I really love your company, 
Hate it when you gotta leave 
Another oppurtunity, 
For me to say everything. 
So tell me if I'm buggin, 
When you look at me like that (like that). 
I wanna say something, 
But I don't know how your gonna react. 

[Robert]
All of a sudden, my vision became so clear.

[Hook]
You knew it all along, 
What was going wrong, 
Let me state my claim 
Before its too late 
I don't care how this may sound, 
But you need to know right now 
So I might as well just come on out and tell ya

Is there anybody here who hears me 
Crying? I'm dying

Is there anybody here,
When it's over? Over

I'm just passin' the time, wonderin'
How you people will ever survive whor-
Ing down your whoring streets, killing 
You while you're killing me

It's time, to show all you people 
You'll never survive

Whoring down your whoring street
Killing you while you're killing me.

Is there anybody here who hears me 
Crying? I'm dying

Is there anybody here,
When it's over? Over

I'm just passin' the time, wonderin'
How you people will ever survive whor-
Ing down your whoring streets, killing 
You while you're killing me

It's time, to show all you people 
You'll never survive

Whoring down your whoring street
Killing you while you're killing me.

Killing you while you're killing me.

Whoring down your whoring street
Killing you while you're killing me.

Is there anybody here who hears me 
Crying? I'm dying

Roll with you
Yeah, roll with you
Roll with you

It's in your eyes just love the way you walk away, knowing that I'm watching you.
Everything about us I can see, it's just the way I thought that it could be.
When you take my hand it's like I never wanna stop the way I feel right now.
You're getting' to me like a fever I can't shake.
Like I'm dreamin' while I'm wide awake.

Lucky, my friends say I'm lucky.
Steepin' in the city with you it's lock down.
Crazy, I must be crazy.
'cause it feels crazy good.

When I roll with you in the night, music ragin', floor is shakin'
Couldn't get any better than this, doesn't get any better than this.
Wanna roll with you by my side, beats bangin', sensation.
Couldn't get any better than this, doesn't get any better than this.

Took a little time for me to find a way for me to really be myself.
Always hangin' out and runnin' with the crowd
Then you dropped the bomb, gave me something that nobody ever did before.
Kinda like this groove it just feels right, kinda like the stars light up the night.

Lucky, my friends say I'm lucky.
Steepin' in the city with you it's lock down.
Crazy, I must be crazy.
'cause it feels crazy good.

When I roll with you in the night, music ragin', floor is shakin'
Couldn't get any better than this, doesn't get any better than this.
Wanna roll with you by my side, beats bangin', sensation.
Couldn't get any better than this, doesn't get any better than this.

Nothin' better baby, but you and me in the glow, you feel the same way, and I like it When you
Let me know let me know.
Special somethin', I don't know what it is, but I count my blessings that you're right here with me.

I wanna roll with you in the night, music ragin', floor is shakin'.
Couldn't get any better than this, doesn't get any better than this.
Wanna roll with you by my side, beats bangin', sensation.
Couldn't get any better than this, doesn't get any better than this.

Just wanna roll with you in the night.
Roll with you.
Music bangin', floor is shakin'.
Couldn't get any better than this, doesn't get any better than this.
Wanna roll with you by my side, beats bangin', sensation.
Couldn't get any better than this, doesn't get any better than this.

""Out on the road, it's dark and it's cold,""
Said my mother as she passed by.
""You'll never stick it long enough.
You're a fool to even try.
You've gone off with a band of men, all addicts, skites, and bums.
So you think you will enjoy your life in the tenancy and the slums.""

Tur ra la, tu ra la, tu ra la, li.
Out on the road is where your Uncle died.
Tur ra la, tu ra la, tu ra la, li.
I have no time for you on the road.

""Playing music ain't no way to live.
It's hungry, cold, and slack.
And if you walk out that door my Son,
Well, you won't be coming back.""

But it's down the pub, all my friends are there.
And there's no place that I'd rather be.
So, you think this life will engulf me?
Well I'll tell you we'll just wait and see.

So I kissed my tearful Father at the door and I left him there.
With five bottles of Bushmill's and two on my chair.
We set out for the county Clare.

And it's Ceili's jigs and booze in Killrush.
Dooneed can be quite a thrill,
And I won't come back 'till I've made my name,
Until I have had my fill.

Please don't take him just because you can
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

Action's too fast, time's too slow
Waiting for you, when you show,
We finally meet, then I finally know,
Is it time to stay or finally go.
Well? I hear that you've met a friend of mine,
I guess it's true what they say, there's really not enough time
To do all the things I wanted to do,
Before you say, hey you're through.
No voice, no choice, can't fight, nothing to win.
Wake up, time to go, pass out, take it fast.
A night's sleep may be a soul earned, but stick around
You'll get your turn, it happens just like that.

Almost got what I wanted, almost got what I needed,
Tried to get it from you, you act so conceited,
So hey mom, come here, 'cause I really like it there,

Pride on my shoulder with a chip on the other,
Target excites, I got both my hands on her thighs.

And I've been spending too much time in California
Where your feelings change but seasons never do
And in my dream last night I felt a storm was coming
But awoke to sunny skies of baby blue

And I call her up to let her go today
For a moment thought it easier then being away
But through the tangled thread the needle finds a way
And I'm asking her to stay

And I've been spending all my time composing letters
To a girl who lives a thousand miles away
But writing never takes the place of living
And I need her arms, I need her smile again

And she called me up to let me go today
For a moment thought it easier than being away
But through the tangled thread the needle finds a way
And I'm asking her to stay

Won't you stay?
Won't you stay?

And there's a feeling in the morning
That I can get my stomach screams a warning
As my first thoughts are forming in my head
And I can lay between the covers
Remember how I loved another
And postpone my slow recovery

but I can fall asleep tonight
If I can make it home by the daylight
When I recall the times that I was left alone
'cause in the glimmer of your eye
I begin to see myself in a different light

And there's a feeling in the morning
That I can get my stomach screams a warning
As my first thoughts are forming in my head
And they say, ""whoa, baby, I gotta go...
And I hate to let you know that this way.""

but I can fall asleep tonight
If I can make it home by the daylight
When I recall the times that I was left alone
'cause in the glimmer of your eye
I begin to see myself in a different light

When I recall the times that I was left alone

Bottle, bottle, on the wall, who's the drunkest of us all?
Set yourself up for the fall, who's a slave to alcohol,
I know a place where you can go, you'll probably see no one that you know,
A few minutes will make you think you probably need another drink.
They said that I had a disease, I asked them, ""What?"" if they please,
I asked them what the fuck they meant,
Victim of the six percent,
Now I'm so ashamed of it,
I guess it's time that I quit.
I saw a friend the other day, getting out of N.A.
He was looking really good, that made me think of myself,
I care about my worthless friends, don't like to see them kill themselves,
Get so strung out they lose all hope, why do you think they call it dope?
Trembling hands, blooodshot eyes, propose a toast to my demise.
God gave me this liver,
I didn't know he was an indian giver.

Can I say I miss you for lack to obtain.
Oh just a few good reasons to keep this interesting,
But again I lack in social skills.
So can I say I need you for planning my next trip.
Oh on a guilt vacation. I feel sorry for it.

But again, it's not the first time thought I was losing what was mine.
I won't wait for a reason,
I'm taking over and back what is mine.
I won't wait forever.

Can I say I want you. it's a quarter to ten.
For so many reasons, I hate to turn to this.

But again, it's not the first time thought I was losing what was mine.
I won't wait for a reason,
I'm taking over and back what is mine.
I won't wait forever.

Does this endless wrecking ball
Involve anyone or anything at all
Be careful how much you take
They're watching your every move
Waiting on your dance floor
Endless get away
Confessed to a wall
Cause these kind of drinks will make you crawl
Beg rip of your face
So be careful how much you take
They're watching your every move
Waiting on your dance floor
Because you'll never make the right decisions
With busy hands and blurry vision
Mislead you know you won't admit it
You went against your own
She's dead you might have over did it
Now you're on your own
The days are long but the nights are longer
And after midnight the drinks can only get stronger
The end it near so we become smoke and we become mirrors
Come home with me now
I won't have you any other way

Don't give a dose to the one you love most.
Give her some marmalade...give her some toast.
You can give her the willies or give her the blues.
But the dose that you give her will get back to youse.

I once had a lady as sweet as a song.
She was my darlin', and she was my dear.
But she had a dose, and she passed it along.
Now she's gone, but the dose is still there.

So, don't give a dose to the one you love most.
Give her some marmalade...give her some toast.
You can give her a partiridge up in a pear tree,
But the dose that you give her might get back to me.

So if you've got an itchin'...if you've got a drip,
Don't sit there wishin' for it to go 'way.
If there's a thing on the tip of your thing or your lip,
Run down to the clinic today, and say...

""I won't give a dose to the one I love most.
I'll give her some marmalade...give her some toast.""
Give her the willies or give her the blues,
But the dose that you give her will get back to you.

Don't go acting all innocent
It suits you all too much
I know the messages we've sent
Have helped us get in touch
There was a time you showed me the pictures
Butter wouldn't melt in your mouth
But now let's skip to the future
Look at you now

Don't want you making no big mistake
Especially when it's dark
Not to mention the risk you take
While drinking in the park
There was a time you showed me the pictures
Butter wouldn't melt in your mouth
But now let's skip to the future
Look at you now

The triumph of hope over experience
My faith has been restored
An uncommon sense of commonsense
Sure is its own reward
There was a time you showed me the pictures
Butter wouldn't melt in your mouth
But now let's skip to the future
Look at you now
Don't go acting all innocent
Look at you now

Dreamin', am I dreamin'?
Try as hard as I can I just can't get you out of my mind
Dreamin', am I dreamin'?
Will my dreams come true or am I simply wasting my time?

Well, I told you that I'm sorry, didn't mean to make you cry
But look at it from my point of view
It's the little things in life on which our happiness depends
And what's the use if any in trying to survive
All the problems that the world can provide
If at the end of all it we haven't got the time to be friends?

Well, I get this funny feeling that just won't stay away
You know it drives me almost out of my mind
It seems that life's too short to carry on the way that we do
Too much discrimination is keeping us apart
And I don't think I can take any more
I only hope and pray I can find a way to say ""I love you""

Oh wouldn't it be great if we could be in that state forever
Just a moment with you in the next year or two or whenever
Let's make history together

Dreamin', am I dreamin'?
Try as hard as I can I just can't get you out of my mind
Dreamin', am I dreamin'?
Will my dreams come true or am I simply wasting my time?
Try as hard as I can I just can't get you out of my mind

Everyone's had a day like yours,
But you should know that you're not alone,
'Cause we'll be there with you always,
Call us up. Let's go!

I know when I go low,
I know where I can go,
Find those who help me,
And I find out why so,
I know it's hard to know
Exactly where to go
I find my way so no one else
Can feel left out (?)

[Chorus]
And when you feel let down
No one wants to be around
It's alright, we'll stay by your side.
And we'll get through it together

Some days are dark, I know.
That's why I think it's important to
Surround ourselves with friends who stay close
Feel stronger are along
Go on you always know that
If you need help I'll be there tomorrow.

[Chorus]
I know you're feelin' down
No one wants to be around,
It's alright, we'll stay by your side.
And we'll get through it together.

To pick me up when I fall down,

Flood this room (completely sealed) with my regrets. (with water dark and cold) Cold they climb (it's rushing in) above my knees. (my heart begins to slow) Slow enough for me to sleep. (So sorry, I lost my way)

Not worried or afraid. Just sorry I lost my way in these sleepless dreams.

Brace the doors. (against my weight) Don't let me out (not even if I scream) scream for help (there's no one home) This water's cold. (my heart begin's to slow)

Slow enough for me to sleep.
(So sorry, I lost my way)

(I'm just sorry I lost my way)

Not worried or afraid. Just sorry I lost my way in these sleepless dreams.

Freedom's just a word to those who give in,
Or a state of mind for those who put out,
Everything they have for an absence,
Or another word for no oppression,
Your sterile, fake community means un-civil liberty,
But it's out there, if you want it,
A change, a social change, is out there, if you want it.
Street politics are an important part of life,
You gotta know something about it if you don't want to die,
But if you die you say it's not gonna matter,
Cause all your life, it was handed to you on a platter.
Your sterile, fake community means un-civil liverty,
But it's out there, if you want it.
Money, happiness, freedom, a saviour, if you want it.
So go and die for whatever you don't believe in.
From the day that I was born,
Stars and stripes, a uniform,
Permanently rearrange,
Don't you sense a certain change?
A message to all, not just some,
Sprayed on the wall, legalize freedom
Hold your ground, keep it down, don't sell yourself short
Subvert? Don't vote? Do I have a right to bitch?
Does it count?

Have you ever walked the lonesome hills
Or heard the curlews cry
Or seen the raven black as night
Upon a windswept sky
To walk the purple heather
And hear the west wind cry
To know that's where the rapparee must die

Since Cromwell pushed us westward
To live our lowly lives
There's some of us have deemed to fight
From Tipperary mountains high
Noble men with wills of iron
Who are not afraid to die
Who'll fight with gaelic honour held on high

[Chorus]
A curse upon you Oliver Cromwell
You who raped our Motherland
I hope you're rotting down in hell
For the horrors that you sent
To our misfortunate forefathers
Whom you robbed of their birthright
""To hell or Connaught"" may you burn in hell tonight

Of one such man I'd like to speak
A rapparee by name and deed
His family dispossessed and slaughtered
They put a price upon his head
His name is know in song and story
His deeds are legends still
And murdered for blood money
Was young Ned of the hill

You have robbed our homes and fortunes
Even drove us from the land
You tried to break our spirit
But you'll never understand
The love of dear old Ireland
That will forge and iron will
As long as there are gallant men
Like young Ned of the hill

[Chorus]

Here comes the man with concussions in his pocket.
Here comes the man with a laser-guided rocket.
Here comes the man with a fistful of pills so you can kill with no remorse,
With no recourse, dance on your conscience until it's a corpse.
War never ends.
War never begins.
Hoist up the hag of destitution!
His mouth's an empty room where wild woes wander.
Young machetes in lingerie charm us all into a frenzy.
His mouth's an empty hole full of quadriplegics.
Here comes the man.
So you charge into battle, muscles rippling, tanks tingling.
Before you fire a shot a white flash feels up your flesh
And cloaks you in a robe of blood, maydays you in a ship of mud.
War never ends.
War never begins.
Hoist up the hag of destitution!
His mouth's an empty room where wild woes sleep sow.
Young machetes in lingerie charm us all into a frenzy.
His mouth's an empty hole full of quadriplegics.
They left you for dead in the desert haunted with the ghosts of prostitutes.
They want you!
They want you!
Dress my corpse up in a low-cut dress.
Drizzle lipstick on my charred french kiss.
Dip my severed jaw in cheap cologne, push-up bras dangling from snapped elbows.
But death's just death no matter how you dress it up.

Here it comes again, a thorn in my side, a set of rules or a set up,
Give me grief and run it in just by the tone of your voice,
Something pained the side of me, I can't figure out.
All the pressures the day inflicts,
All the pain that makes that clock inside your heart tick.
Something pained the side of me, I can't figure it out.
Destroying me by the tone of your voice
Why can't you see that you're losing me, putting me in misery.

I dreamed last night No more cops
It felt alright No more cops
No need to fight No more cops

'Cause no one needs to steal
Everyone gets a meal
If it was only real
We'd need no more cops

I dreamed last night no police
An army-less world doomed to peace
And now as all my dreaming stops
I see it clear, we need no more cops

No need to fear
I'd want to cheer
And I wish you were here
Before my slumber stops

It seems to me
That if we're really free
We need no more cops

No Holy War No more God
No more rent No more deeds
No more money No more greed
No more hate No more fear

No one unhappy No one sad
No one ripped off No one mad
But I awake Here instead
I wish I had Stayed in bed

I'd stay asleep in the deep
And in my thoughts I'd keep
No more cops

When life gets mean
Share in the dream
Until you scream - no more cops
I dreamed late last night

No more cops
No more cops
No more cops

I never wanted to admit to this but my love wasn't true
I rescue the lonely because I'm lonely too
And the way you smile the way you laugh
Reminds me of myself
Before I fell apart like a drug infected heart
All along in a city by the sea
Dirty leaves fall around
All alone and suddenly it seems
Dirty leaves fall for you and me
I never wanted your heart to break
But we still knew it would
Impossible to save
But did when I could
I replaced your tears your loneliness with cigarettes and wine
But you needed more and we ran out of time
Now your love is gone
All all alone in the city by the sea
Dirty leaves fall all around
And suddenly it seems
Dirty leaves fall for you and me
And once again I'm torn between saving you or saving me
That's why I begged you not to stay
Any longer than you should
Because I always knew you would
And now it builds more every day
Until you're just an object in my way
Choking on the words I never wanted you to say
All all alone in the city by the sea
Dirty leaves fall all around
And suddenly it seems
Dirty leaves fall for you and me

I sit alone
I drink alone
I was born alone
I'll die alone
I dream alone
I heal alone
I exist alone
And maybe now that's a lot of alone to put up with

But I like drinking on a Monday mornin'
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday too
Friday, Saturday, Sunday mornin'
Monday morning start anew

Well I been mistreated so my damaged self image
Is what I learned when I believed that what was said was true
Try harder, ya punk, you're an idle underachiever
Maybe so but I'll spite you now I've somethin' to prove
I've taken every behavior and identity on
Because I surely learned to be ashamed of my own
But aggression's not conflict resolution
Even though family, government, society and wrestling tell ya so

Well there's life outside school and your parents garden
So let go of how you learned your defences that way
It's probably you who's being selfish
No one has to stay with you when that's what you say
You take your anxieties out on other people
When you feel their behavior isn't true to you
And chemically on yourself when your damaged self image
Adheres to MacGowan's philosophy and other men's truths


Learning to let go of ideals and other people should be a virtue
Instead of torturing other for life
Never learning, never open, 'cause you've all these conclusions
Just 'cause it didn't work for your parents
No need to force it to work with your wife
Well no one can make me happy or see my side
Cause the anxiety's internal that makes us sad
So reassess addiction to chemicals and chronic wankin'
Well if that's what makes me happy then I've always been sad

Ignite these flakes with flecks of blue and red. Through the window of my ambulance. Run through the events in shattered sequence. This shallow grave could mark the end.

Quicken the pace of five heartbeats.
Eyes on me. (There are things you shouldn't see So keep your eyes on me) Now it's white on white, I'm helpless on my side. On my side, my side. Don't take this from me. It's everything I need. So keep your eyes on me. There are things you shouldn't see, like this absent memory

Wade through the knee-deep snowdrifts in my head so I can see before the world spun left. Regret is all that I can grasp unlike the steering wheel that's in my hands.
Freeze. It's only 21 degrees.
(There's no traction; No traction) The traction is gone. Hands slip, no grip, never forget. Wake up, wake up, wake up. It's my fault. Sometimes there's something so wrong. Don't stop, don't take this away. Give back my gravity. I said it's my fault. Sideways against the grain. Don't flip, don't flip, don't flip, don't flip: We're over.

In my dreams of Death, you were there
The perfect crime, take my final breath
The noose pulls tight, a perfect fit
Swallow me up with your mistrust
There's a monster in my mirror
Dragging me through hell and misery
But when I smash that mirror
It sets me free

In the park I sat down withy my love,
And not a thing was wrong.
The sun shone down from above,
And not a thing was wrong.

And I go to where our voices paired,
And leapt from off the stone.
And that's the voice that I still here whenever I sing alone, alone.
Whenever I sing alone.

Not many a thought did I abide,
Nor was I help when things went wrong.
At the cemetery by your graveside,
Now everything is wrong.

Well I know exactly where I'm going,
And God knows who I adore.
Tho' my prayers did ask to take my pain,
I wish I could've taken yours much more.

Phoenix Park in summertime,
Gathering by day and night.
By the hearth in wintertime,
Gathering just to say goodbye.

It's three o'clock at the end of the day.
It's three o'clock in the morning gray.
I'm alone and I'm very, very worried.

All the bottles of wine have ravaged my mind.
Another day's gone by and I'm worried.

And the night, and the night, it is bitter and short.
For I know that a new day is coming.
Another day, another day, all alone and blue.
But for you I've pursued nothing.

I dropped out of school to dwell on a dream,
And now all that guilt is engulfing me.

I can't concentrate, I'm failing.
Oh, were can she be?
I'm alone and I'm very, very worried.

I know that I've always felt this way.
God, I know that it's always been this way.
Since I was young, I've always felt this way.
Well, do I fuck myself for the consistency?

I know that I have stumbled, and I know I've not been sharp.
And when I'm leaving this world behind,
I won't bring another soul here to fall flat on their face,
Or leave this world unkind.

Last night I lay all in my dreams, when a rap
At the door it startled me.
And I heard those footsteps on the stairs,
And I bade her; please come in.

Come in, come in, my roving friend.
Come in and rest awhile.
For you've been gone so very long,
It's nice to see you smile.
Come in, come in, my wandering friend.
Accept my welcome home.
I hope you can stay a long, long while before you have to go.

And she walked across the room to me,
And then she sat right down with me,
And told me that she had to leave.
She could not stay for long.

A child he held in his arms, a child that I
Knew well through time, and told me that he had to leave.
He had to take him home.

She crossed the floor and moved away,
And my heart said, ""Stop her. Maker her stay.""
But I just showered myself in tears, for I just let her go.

When I awoke I cried and cried,
And went to sit by his graveside,
And visit the child he left behind.
Because he had to go.

You must come back to me again.
Accept the welcome I extend.
I will not let you go this time,
If only in my dreams.

And yeah, though you walk ever on,
May your heart be not weary but strong.
And yeah, though you walk ever on,
Through the valley of the shadow of death.

Lay her rest with violence and a cold encryption
Empty casket send her to hell with no prescriptions
Glue a mirror to the inside of her empty coffin
So she can stare at her dead face
And follow her new faith home
All the way straight to hell
Dark skies, no flowers, no need for visiting hours
Lowered in trash and let the goddamn earth
Come and search for treasure
Cause who's going to love you now that no one can penetrate you
No one can hear you cum
So follow your new faith home
All the way
All the way back to hell
Because as far as we can tell
There isn't any way
She has to pay
I'm sorry but it's true
You can't save anyone
From her first love to her bastard son
For all of the things that she's done
Dear god I can't wait to finally meet you
You selfish cunt, you've got some explaining to do
Cause we only wish we knew
Anyway
She has to pay
I'm sorry but it's true

From her first love to her bastard son
For all of the things that she's done
Dear god I can't wait to finally meet you

Let's sling our rain slicks over February's fantastic antlers
Sprouting from the foreheads of world famous romancers.
The winter's looming like a bloodthirsty bird of prey.
And I guarantee by spring we'll either be world famous or goddamned dead.
Guitar one fastens languid years to busty bones like dust and skin on a dull antique moon.
Guitar two's touch keeps ruining lovers for other lovers
Like jokers concealed in trick decks in our laps.
There's a train tumbling down torn paper tracks while weeds blossom from heartbeats that lack.
Guitar three's dancing even though her song stopped playing ages and ages ago.
She's at an empty dance club suspended in the middle of a rambling sentence.
Guitar four says, ""if you still believe in the grace of man,
Let me introduce you to greedy greedy hands.""
Let's sling our rain slicks over every single second
To the rapture dripping from clocks ticking all our misadventures.
The winter left town with some seventeen-year-old waitress.
And spring's laying in a pile of all the moments of our misadventures.

My great Grandpa was a king, a monarch stout and noble.
He surveyed this land so green, and he said ""She's fair and humble"".
As far as the eye can see, from Carrauntooil to Giant's Causeway was ours,
Until they went and made a criminal of me.

Many a Celtic head had rolled, and rolled upon the hillside,
And they bathed their horses hooves in Hibernian blood and their hide.
In exile they did flee, and set up a church and home there,
'till the landlord and the bailiff made it criminality.

Oh, and on the road they came to run, run until the runnin's done.
Run far away from fettered chain, the land was ours to barter.
We succumb from sweat and strain, and look they're right behind again.
If they catch me boys, I know they'll make a criminal of me.

A criminal of me, a criminal of me.
Wandering forever, hungering eternally.

A criminal of me, a criminal of me.
Run, run, before they make a criminal of me.

Across the sea they sailed, to a land both bright and noble.
For they'd watched their neighbors starve, and the bloodline as it fumbled.
As they reached the safer side, ole Papa said to Jimmy,
To try and live a life so they'd not make a criminal of he.

""Go be alert,"" sad Da, ""do not perish for the gentry.""
Tho' poor but proud was he, whenever they called discretely,
Well he'd smash their faces in and in gaol he died poorly.
""But,"" he said, ""don't let them try and make a criminal of ye.""

Oh, now my boss he steps so gay, so gaily up the street,
While I dull the pain in pubs and still can't afford to eat.
He is dashing, he is fancy and he'll never want you see.
Evan as the factory shuts his shoes reflect the criminal in me.

Violent and drunk now in the street with nothing to sustain me,
I'm gonna die here in this hole. The kids I can't take care of with me.
But it must be taught to let the blame and hatred out of their heads.
For anger and danger make you just another pathetic, drunken, violent paddy dead.

No matter what I try is no good for you
Everything that I say, everything that I do
It's crystal clear now that we're going nowhere
And that once was a dream has become this nightmare
Wish I never loved you but I just can't let go

Now I know how it feels to have loved and lost
Because of pride
To be deserted so that hurt is all that's left inside
I'm ashamed I've been blamed so much I wanted to die
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
Wish I never loved you but I just can't let go

What makes me think I mean nothing to you ?
Everything that you say, everything that you do
All you excuses, the lies you invent
Provide more than a little discouragement
Wish I never loved you but I just can't let go

Now I know how it fells to have loved and lost
Because of pride
To be deserted so that hurt is all that's left inside
I'm ashamed I've been blamed so much I wanted to die
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why, tell me why

Out with the old, in with the new
Change my appearance/sound/attitude to impress you
Do everything just one way
But change my mind day to day
It's so predictable it will never happen again
Correct my mistakes then I rip off a friend
Time is short, it goes too fast
Think what you've done in the past
All those things that have happened to you
And all the things you are gonna go through
It's so typical but what's done is done
I keep playing my games and what hurts is fun
Emotions spill just like wine
Tears flow in one straight line
Hearts break, it's no mistake
It's a shallow truth, I can see you're fake
Now it's time to rap my rhyme, rock it into overtime
But it's the wrong way to go. Isn't that just typical?

Panic, the earth is heaving up beneath me. I've got nothing to say to besides it's over. Fire breaks through the window pane, it's coming. The guilt weighs down on me, heavy. This is the last moment that I'll ever feel. Then finally I find the thing that keeps me safe. Here comes the rain. To douse the flame, to wash away all my mistakes. Ruins stand stark against the sky and smolder. The air is heavy and it smells of sulfur. Sirens warn of the coming fear, take cover. Here comes the second wave for me. Triggered, by my failures. Carried, in the flames. Our part, is ending, trust me, I'm not afraid. Black smoke, on the horizon, the sky is burning, but where are you, I won't die alone. I won't die. Then finally (Then finally) I find the thing (That keeps me safe) Here comes the rain (To douse the flame) To wash away (All my mistakes)

Paralyzed between these metal walls.
And how I wish I had something more than this.
Is this success?
'Cause when I'm home, it's just another day.
A piece of the furniture with nothing to say.
Your jester who lives to fail.

Everything that was written by me is complicated.
I swear I give you my words.
They get mixed up sometimes,
And everything that was written by me,
What's the meaning? I swear I give you my words.
They get lost sometimes.

Oh, it's cute to kiss and tell.
But the craziest part is that you all will never know for sure,
Did I mean it all?
Any part at all?
They lyrics are just a fragile wall to keep me guarded from you.

You'll never get it.

So take a minute and ask yourself why
Every second you're after just seems to pass.
Take a minute and ask why you ran away from it.
And every moment, thereafter, is a relapse.
From the memory before to the one that just passed.
Take a minute and ask yourself why.
It's easier to appease me when you are down on your knees,
And you're begging for me.
To take it easy on you, it's easier to
Leave you when you're down...

These are just wasted intentions.
They're mixed up and they're all pretentious.
Yesterday seemed so long ago,
And the best of me is almost too hard to find...
These are just wasted intentions.
They're mixed up and they're all pretentious.
Why do you face this alone?

So now you've watched the playback in your mind.
Would you agree that you let it all slip past?
I just had to ask why it got away from you.
Does every regret burn from the inside?
From the memory before to the one that just passed,
Watch it again and ask yourself why?
It's easier to appease me when you are down on your knees and alone.

These are just wasted intentions.
They're mixed up and they're all pretentious.
Yesterday seemed so long ago,
And the best of me is almost too hard to find...
These are just wasted intentions.
They're mixed up and they're all pretentious.

Somewhere along the way I had to break away
Just like a flash of light seen running into the night
I can't quit, I won't stop
I confessed I've always been a mess
And then I woke up in your wedding dress
Baby, you know I gotta swing from gallows
Cause my head already hangs low
Cause these days are so slow
Give me an empty canvas
So I can throw it away
Cause 26 years on the run ain't no fun
I can't quit I won't stop
No matter what you say or who you do
There's no way in hell I'm coming back to you
Baby you know, I gotta swing from gallows
Cause my head already hangs low
Cause these days are so slow
I don't want romance and I don't need a second chance
I just want out of this fucking quicksand
I gotta burn this wasteland down
Because I'm tired of fucking around
Baby you know I gotta swing from gallows
Cause my head already hangs low cause these days are so slow
I don't want romance and I don't need a second chance

Steal the breath from me. It's yours to take. I give it freely. Shake me from my sleep. To see the things. I could have done. To change everything. To be in place. To drive you both home. Not to gravestones. Take you somewhere safe.

Speak to me in memories. To comfort me. A welcomed haunting. This is my
Apology. This fallacy. A welcomed haunting silence ringing through
The city. Sorrow floods the streets.

It occurs to me. I haven't seen. Where you've been sleeping. Crushed so
Deep beneath reality. Just over six feet. What could I have done. Is
All I'll think. To drive you both home. Not to gravestones. Take you
Somewhere safe.

Sirens (I am) Blaring (Failing) Echo through the trees (rest in peace)
Silence (Silent) Waiting (Funeral) (Procession)
Two are missing heartbeats (Through the streets)

Lift the coffin weight. I feel ashamed. There's something missing
The black hearse waits below. Down by the road. To drive you both
Home To your graves your final resting place

This town's views are old
This town's grey and cold
This place to the west
This place I like the best
This place reeks of death

Of rich little girls and their cheap little games,
Until one night something happened, occurred,

I'm the cosmic teeth grinder,
My lord's calling me home,
And I stand all alone.

Twilight's million battered lips sleep in a house of fractured smiles.
Young love's clumsy fingertips are gonna find out for themselves.
The birds keep on singing from the tops of trees,
But the song's out of tune that drips from the breeze.
There's a razor in the garden waiting for a delicate head.
Look out!
Look out!
For diamonds sparkling where the trap doors swing into the bottom
Of a cold misery full of insults to add to your collection,
Parking lots dangling from your diction, daydreams bobbing in a shattered sea.
Look out!
Look out!
For sirens dancing where the nooses swing from gutted branches
Of your fantasies full of insults falling from your ceiling,
Motels where you're fucking without feeling, daydreams bobbing in a shattered sea.
Fake leaves shake like deceit on your tongue.
Desperate mothers devoured by young.
Hold on to love you learned to despise like an ocean choking on its own tide.
There's a razor in the garden waiting to cut through your seams.
Look out!
Look out!
The dull years drag the best days of your life through asphalt
And glass while summer's favorite fathers birthing next year's deadbeat dads.
Let's tack up another eviction note to matrimony's throbbing throat
Stuffed with songs from a synthetic past,
Silver clouds and artifacts full of insults to add to your collection,
Parking lots dangling from your diction, daydreams bobbing in a shattered sea.

Victory of heart, presence of mind
A smile on my face
I know what the next night brings
Wear and tear and pretend you care
Nothing is final, but exception is everything
Nothing is final, but exception is anything
Nothing is final, but exception is something
Your premonition, paranoia symptom
You just gotta live and learn

Wake up, the walls have softened up (My foxhole's filling up with mud) Please come save me. We dug this hole, we made it safe (Yet now, you're staring down at me) I'll keep reaching. I won't give up (Because to me it means that much)

(Still fighting, these battles, in our words) (Still fighting, these battles, in our whispers)

We're fighting wars. in our words. In our whispers. So soft they can't be heard. This battle has been lost. This war cannot be won

Discard, every word I said (and I'll still love you just the same) Clear out my head. This world is breaking all around (still you refuse to make a sound) I'm not breathing. Please lift me now

(Do something, call out ""man down!"")

Pay for your treason. your betrayal. Live in exile for fighting wars like whispers.

Now how do you plead?

We'll live out our lives on this dirty old street,
Only because we just can't compete.
But in the concrete of our younger days, we left our names.

Just like the people before, when they reached
The distant shore with their drink and their dance,
And their dreams and sincere aims.

Ghosts long gone, through old buildings they stare.
With their offspring staring at me for they are still there.
Dreams that are dead and lives not realized.

Why did we write our names in these streets,
To show we're alive?

Well, Chicago is my home and I'll never want to roam,
To live on any sun swept distant shore.
Well, it is where I was reared by forbearers so revered,
And I sing the songs that they all sang before.

Well, any woman that's neared me
Has been repelled most thoroughly.
Still I'm a lover God, I am foremost of all.
A musician that's my call of high degree professional.
But I'm afraid I do not know my trade at all.

And if it's every twenty years
Some small relief to me appears,
Then the crock of gold will wait until that day.

To defend myself no more,
Lay the shield of anger at my door
And the sword of alcohol will stow away.

All the people in our town are overworked and broken down.
Begging cheques but it's just not enough they're giving.
Crying quietly, living life so desperately.
That something has to make this life worth living.

Real life is only a timeline,
And the excitement holds the short times.
It will never measure up to what TV sells as great.
All the drunken jokes and views,
Exciting pubs they tell the news.
But the exciting pats, well, they just weren't all that great.

I met a girl one night and enchantment fixed our sight,
So we decided we would hold it for awhile.
But she would not love me, so inside me finally said,
""It's not your fault.""
But I would like love if only for a while.

Well, it's on and on I've seen, yeah that's how it's always been,
And how it will be as ever on I go.
Oh, but ever on I will.
Through all the banal times until I find some
Place to me that seems like home.

We're in love, sweet love.

We built our life from nothing.
We don't have much, no more money
But we've got love.
We can only grow much better
I'm so glad we're here together, and on our own, in love.

And in just a few more years
I'll prove everyone wrong.

Well everybody I know
Has one good chance to die
To be swallowed whole by the big blue empty sky
Feel the heavens stare
With a cold hard look in it's eyes
To hear the sound of something awful on the rise
So pray for safe passage through the night
You'll be humbled by sounds of daylight
And this is an endless search
To find how much is enough
This could be so much worse
But we sold our souls for gold
You know that nobody in this room
Wants to hear you cry
And if nobody goes for help
Baby you're gonna die
It came and went so fast
You'd almost thought you'd missed
A chance to shake your head and say
How did it come to this
Pray for safe passage through the night
You'll be humbled by the sounds of daylight
And this is an endless search
To find how much is enough
This could be so much worse
But we sold our souls for gold
We sold our souls
We sold our souls

Well here I am again
In a foreign town where I know no one
On another continent
Well it's four o'clock and I'm with someone
That I haven't met before
But I don't feel like I should leave
Well I might not find the door
Anyway the miracle's stirring me

So play on let 'em play for me
Just drag that bow across the string
So play on let 'em all night long
Oh I love to hear our gypsies songs
Away, away, oh I'm far away from home
Away, away, and the wonder lingers on

Postcards, stamps, and songs
And bottles spilled on letters long
The wind through my own hair
At Normandy where I wish you were
Markets strange and surreal
Where black eyes flash from corners dark
The Young ones poor and infirm
They lift their hands to your own heart
Well I've seen this before
Old ones come to pass

With empty eyes bed where there's grass
Skites with steel knuckles and knives
Waiting for a thrity franc paradise
Away, away, oh I'm far away from home
Away, away, and the wonder lingers on

Vodka warm and sharp
Just like what I might drink with you
In a glass on an empty bar
Quite similar to where I would sit with you
And the bar maid smiles at me
And she asks to go and I agree
Into a Spanish night
Into something that I've never seen

Well I've been out walking
I don't do that much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
And all the times I had the chance to

I've stopped my rambling
I don't do too much gambling these days
These days
These days I seem to think about
How all the changes came about my way
And I wonder if I'll see another highway

I had a lover
I don't think I'll risk another these days
These days
And if I seem to be afraid
To live the life I have made in song
It's just that I've been losing so long

Then I'll stop my dreaming
I don't do too much scheming these days
These days
These days I sit on corner stores
And count the time in quarter tones to ten
Please don't confront me with my failures
'Cause I have not forgotten them

What am I doing here?
What happened before?
Did I mess up?

Someone is calling me
Someone is whispering
Then you wake up

And it makes me feel bad
When I find that you're not here
And it makes me so scared
When I find that I'm alone

I can't remember
How was holding your hands tight
Lost in bad light

Suddenly I'm hearing
Darkness around me
Should I wake up

And it makes me feel bad
When I find that you're not here
And it makes me so scared
When I find that I'm alone

Afraid

Should I wake up and call you out loud on and on

Why do you care?

Your love's such a stretch for my faith.

You don't let go easily.
No, you hold onto me tight.
And it's just what I need.
To get me through the storm tonight.

Whoa, I don't have to be afraid of the wind.
And that's good to know.
'Cause I've heard it all before.
But I'm walking on water now.
In the midst of a storm.

My life fell apart and you were right there.
The fire turned my whims into smoke.
I choke on your words that somehow make sense.
And I dance with a joy only found in the pain.

You don't let go easily.

You seemed so strong, stood your ground. Is this enough to make you proud?

The seasons barely change. They move too fast for me.Back home the autumn leaves are falling softly from the trees. Don't take this away, I'm close to sanity. I pushed against the grain and drove a thousand miles away.

There's nothing left (I've given all I have) Done what I can (I've leaned into the wind) It's all (it's all)For you (I've done all that I can) There's nothing left(I've given all I have)

You seemed so strong, stood your ground. Is this enough to make you proud? You seemed so strong, stood your ground. Are you proud?

Winter turns to spring, but it still looks the same. The city is gray and there's still the constant rain. Now I understand the things you gave to me. Because I have the means to fight a faceless enemy.

There's nothing left (I've given all I have) Done what I can (I've leaned into the wind) It's all (it's all) For you (I've done all that I can) There's nothing left (I've given all I have)

You're walking through the forests where they feed the trees broken glass.
John lennon and the rolling stones crooning in plastic bags.
Spit shine your black luck now, baby.
You turn on the radio, the speakers spit tangled talk.
Everything is war and who's fucked their way to the top.
But they'll eat black clouds we all eat black clouds.
You're working on a cruise serving caviar to the cruel.
They repossessed your heart; you're making payments on your face, too.
Spit shine your black clouds now, baby.
And what if your religion turns out to be a cruel joke, and you're fucked beyond all hope?
Gonna spit shine your black clouds now, baby.
First you stayed in bed all day and walked around all night.
Then you threw your phone away and slept beneath the freeway underpass.
Your mother slit her throat after your father's heart attack.
And you've got two little sisters still in school.
What'cha gonna do? what'cha gonna do?
Just sit and watch the ships loading their freight
And pale pelicans feeding their young and grasp at the barbarically charming sun.
Out on the weekend talked your way out of a first date.
Said your uncle was famous, by then it was too late.
Spit shine your black luck now, baby.
Fall asleep to the tv-the cops are talking tough
To the cameras in the backseat, to the audience at home.
But they'll eat black clouds we all eat black clouds.
Once you knew a girl with skin like a sapphire sun.
Took you back to her apartment, told you everything you did wrong.
Spit shine your black luck.
Spit shine your black luck.
The sky's so desolate like flesh on a skull-shaped balloon.
You sit in bed writing love letters to yourself.
No black ink on the black paper, bay.
Stare at the ceiling, fall into dreamless sleep.
Day climbs your chimney, taps you on the shoulder blade,
""spit shine your black clouds now, baby.""
All your best friends grow up to be successful actresses.
All your bitter enemies died of liver failure in kent, washington trailers.
All your brothers made babies until their brains turned brown.
The world's lounging longways on an unbridled black cloud.

Your desperation
Your inspiration

When you finally became a mute,
While a sad song plays,
You lie helpless and lost,
Infected by the truth
That was fabricated by you.
Your image shattered in the eye of the storm.
We would never reach out to you.
How could you?

Your desperation to look like a victim
Is such a cop-out.
You're fooling yourself.
Your inspiration is your contradictions.
You've lost the concept of what's the real truth.

That it's you who is the thief.
Who should by humbled by the
Sheer size of your crimes.
We befriended you.
It was abuse.
There's no better time then the present time
To finally forget you.
How could you?

Your desperation to look like a victim
Is such a cop-out.
You're fooling yourself.
Your inspiration is your contradictions.
You've lost the concept
Of what's the real truth.

Close your eyes, and pretend that it's alright.
Do you feel it tonight?
Can you feel it tonight?
It's all crashing down.

Lately you know you've seen it.
The face, in the mirror never lies.
You're fading.
Fading...

""This next story is a true story.

It concerns two of my favorite subjects:

industrial theft . . . and-a t-ts!

Mmm, what a combo! This is the story . . .

The inventor of the modern foundation garment

that we women wear today was a German scientist

and opera lover by the name of Otto Titsling!

This is a true story.

His name was Otto Titsling.

What happened to Otto Titsling shouldn't happen to a schnauzer.

It's a very sad story. I feel I have to share it with you.""


Otto Titsling, inventor and kraut,

had nothing to get very worked up about.

His inventions were failures, his future seemed bleak.

He fled to the opera at least twice a week.


One night at the opera he saw an Aida

who's t-ts were so big they would often impede her.

Bug-eyed he watched her fall into the pit,

done in by the weight of those terrible t-ts.


Oh, my god! There she blows!

Aerodynamically this bitch was a mess.

Otto eyeballed the diva lying comatose amongst the reeds,

and he suddenly felt the fire of inspiration

flood his soul. He knew what he had to do!

He ran back to his workshop

where he futzed and futzed and futzed.


For Otto Titsling had found his quest:

to lift and mold the female breast;

to point the small ones to the sky;

to keep the big ones high and dry!


Every night he'd sweat and snort

searching for the right support.

He tried some string and paper clips.

Hey! He even tried his own two lips!


Well, he stitched and he slaved

and he slaved and he stitched

until finally one night, in the wee hours of morning,

Otto arose from his workbench triumphant.

Yes! He had invented the worlds first

over-the-shoulder-boulder-holder. Hooray!


Exhausted but ecstatic he ran

down the street to the diva's house

bearing the prototype in his hot little hand.

Now, the diva did not want to try the darn thing on.

But, after many initial misgivings,

she finally did.

And the sigh of relief that issued forth

from the diva's mouth

was so loud that it was mistaken by some

to be the early onset of the Siroccan Winds

which would often roll through the Schwarzwald

with a vengeance!

Ahhhhh-I!


But little did Otto know,

at the moment of his greatest triumph,

lurking under the diva's bed

was none other than the very worst

of the French patent thieves,

Philippe DeBrassiere.

And Phil was watching the scene

with a great deal of interest!


Later that night, while our Brun Hilda slept,

into the wardrobe Philippe softly crept.

He fumbled through knickers and corsets galore,

'til he found Otto's titsling and he ran out the door.


Crying, ""Oh, my god! What joy! What bliss!

I'm gonna make me a million from this!

Every woman in the world will wanna buy one.

I can have all the goods manufactured in Taiwan.""


""Oh, thank you!""


The result of this swindle is pointedly clear:

Do you buy a titsling or do you buy a brassiere?


""Ohhh! Thank you!""

There's not a difference, boo, it's real life..

It's not ya momma fault, it's ya fathers fault
It's your fathers fault your mother is an alcoholic
Confusin the brain from the booze and the pain
And plus he cheated on her, beated on her, smack dead in the rain
She Lost her first child in 74
And that lead to nervous breakdowns bicardi dark she downin it raw
She can't take it she constantly cryin fallin down on her knees
Like help me lord please I'm ready to leave
All she needed was somebody to rub her feet
Give her a nice hug and rescue her from off these streets, come on

There's not a difference, boo, it's only an 8-figure, back me up

I been sent by an angel to snatch you up
Take you way above the clouds and back you up
At night you can lay in my arms feel the heart beatin
Don status in the sheets I'm keepin you warm
Ain't no nigga gone do what I do
Imah take care of you and ya kids
Take the bent and go handle ya biz
The bills is paid,the cable back on
I quote you know the seeds want they nickleodeon on

Wipe ya eyes..

Yo in the hood there's a struggle
My girls is in trouble

Her pops never showed her the ropes
Her moms raised mad kids on her own
She never had a strong man in her home

Stay stroooooooooong
Oh, hey, said we're gonna stay strong
No matter what

Have it sound like _Drumlines_ at A&T, muh'fucker


[Chorus: Redman]

Gilla House - check, Def Squad - check

White tee - check, Goretex - check

When we said we number one - we lied

We number one two three four AND five

Gilla House - check, Brick City - check

89 - check, cash yo - check

""They don't give a fuck about what y'all niggaz doin""

{*scratch: ""Holla at your be-boy-boy!*}


[Redman]

If you find a bag of weed on the floor, pick it up

And if you find it I got 10 on the dub

I'm hard to find like pickin weed out a rug

I'm worldwide fool, I don't care about a buzz

Dawn of the Red, goin for the bread

I got pitbulls hooked on to a sled

My block'll riot like they shot Cornbread

The Pres'll find a missile with a foreign head

KABOOM! Guess who stepped in the room?

Streetsweeper out, ready to vacumn

Then all of a sudden, you get it in the end

Like Kane from Marlena cousin, I'm a menace

I was broke as hell, first time I made it

Now e'rything I own is voice activated

Boy I'm lyin, I'm just tryin to make cheddar

Cause my doorbell is rubbin two wires together


[Chorus: Redman]

Gilla House - check, Wu-Tang - check

White tee - check, Nike Air - check

When we said we number one - we lied

We number one two three four AND five

Gilla House - check, Uptown - check

Purple haze - check, cash yo - check

""They don't give a fuck about what y'all niggaz doin""

{*scratch: ""Holla at your be-boy-boy!*}

[Lil' Zane]

Yeah, Next, uh Lil' Zane

Come on drop the top, let cha' hair fly

It's a clear sky tonight baby

Uh, let me know what's on ya mind

[Tweety]

It's Saturday, get the car shined up

Hair cut lined up, Heaven made my mind up

Professed one side of it tied up, won't see me there

I wonder how she wears her hair

If I see her I swear

I'm gonna put the game down like you

[Chorus: Next]

I'm just looking for love

I've been looking all over the club

Fresh Nikes, jeans cuffed, pressed in Sean John

Trying to find someone, someone for me

[R.L.]

I just tipped valet

Got in line through the metal detectors, stormin' days

Movin' to the sound of the DJ hoping she'll come my way

Is it the girl with the bomb weave, standin' next to me

Or is it the one with the short waves

A few are stepping but I ain't checking cause

[Chorus]

[Lil' Zane]

I switch lanes when I hoop game

Bet I score the same when I shoot game

I promise baby that I change whe the loop came

I'm off to bigger, better things with my new thang

No strings attached I'm on my two-way

Hopin' that our beams'll match

Gotta see you later baby, I'm a fiend for that

Wide body Navigator but my screens are flat

Now we watchin' motion pictures sittin' right in the track

Wanna honey dip, not interested in spendin' money

But how the money flip

She ain't concerned when I earn, she make money chips

I lit the fire place, baby gave me fine face

Tell me what cha' want but shorty I'm not Mase

I'm known for drillin' in a hole like I'm I-A

Fast as a speedin' bullet on the highway

Hopin' that I'm not late

And I ain't worried bout a ticket cause I got cake

Baby I'm lookin' for love

[Chorus repeated to fade; with Next & Lil' Zane ad-libs]

A man and wife had prayed for years for children

Were losing faith and close to giving up

Then a young girl with no way to keep her baby

Laid in their arms a tiny gift of love


It only takes one life to make a miracle

One tiny ray of hope to light up the dark

It only takes one life to make a miracle

One honest prayer coming from the heart


A small coal mining town in West Virginia

Prayed as they kept vigil day and night

Saddened by the twelve who lives were taken

But also thankful one made it out alive


It only takes one life to make a miracle

One tiny ray of hope to light up the dark

It only takes one life to make a miracle

One honest prayer coming from the heart


Two thousand years ago the world lay waiting

For the Savior they were told would come

Then on that winter night there in a manger

God blessed the world with his one and only son


It only takes one life to make a miracle

One tiny ray of hope to light up the dark

It only takes one life to make a miracle

One honest prayer coming from the heart


It takes one honest prayer coming from your heart

Ahh, ahh, ahh - tonight
Ahh, ahh
Object movers have done nothing on me
Take me to the party I just want to feel free
I won't pass the bastard? nightmares into another Sunday
I won't pass the bastard? nightmares into another Sunday

When they asked me want I wanted to do
What kind of job do you think we're due to
I said I don't know I just want to feel alive tonight
Well I don't know I just want to feel alive tonight

Remember high life isn't won by degrees
No one understands it, just like your little sneeze???????
But there is another world where you can't see me
But there is another world where you can't see me

When they asked me want I wanted to do
What kind of job do you think we're due to
I said I don't know I just want to feel alive tonight
Well I don't know I just want to feel alive tonight

Tonight
Tonight
Well that's right

[Solo]

When they asked me want I wanted to do
What kind of job do you think we're due to
I said I don't know I just want to feel alive tonight
Well I don't know I just want to feel alive tonight

To-to-tonight
To-to-tonight
When they asked me
Well when they asked me
I just want to be alive to-
I just want to be alive to-
To-to-tonight
To-to-to-tonight
To-to-to-tonight
To-to-to-tonight
To-to-to-tonight

Am I the one in control?

Ami I the one at the wheel?

Last time I checked, it was my turn

to say how I feel

Cause you're not the one going through with it

and you're not the one who gotta do it

Am I the one at the wheel?


Don't let go

It's always on the tip of my tongue

I won't take another second

Don't lay low

Boy you better keep listening cause

I'm gonna tell you when it's over

but it's not over yet


I can't sit and listen to what you have to say

I'm sick of hearing your voice

I'm sick of going your way

cause you're not the one who's gotta live with it

and you're not the one who's giving in to it

I'm sick of hearing your voice


(Don't let go..)


Don't talk to me like you can't believe

That I don't know what I want when I want it

Don't question me about what I need

I'll fill you in

When I'm ready for it

If you don't let me take my time

Nothing's gonna feel right

I won't forget to tell you when

I'm gonna tell you when it's over

but it's not over yet


Don't let go

It's always on the tip of my tongue

I won't take another second

Won't let go

You'll be the first to know when I'm done

Hate to say but I've just begun

Don't lay low

Boy you better keep listening cause

I'm gonna tell you when it's over

but it's not over yet

And I don't care what anyone thinks about me
I'm not afraid of what you say or do
It doesn't hurt me I'm telling you

that I'm completely over it and I don't care what you do

I'm really really glad and really really really happy
And I'm feeling good
I'm really really glad and really really really happy and I'm
Feeling good I'm feeling free and nothing's bothering me

and what I say is real and it's about time
I used to be so mad and crazy
Almost all of the time I'm telling you

That I'm completely turned around and feeling like I should

I'm really really glad and really really really happy
And I'm feeling good
I'm really really glad and really really really happy and I'm
Feeling good I'm feeling free and nothing's bothering me

what I say or what I do it makes me wanting to
Tell you everybody in a happy tune-yeah

[solo]

and I don't care what anyone thinks about me
I'm not afraid of what you say or do it doesn't hurt me I'm telling you
That I'm completely over it and I don't care what you do

I'm really really glad and really really really happy and I'm feeling good

As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inchy stump
Dressed like a priest you was,
Todd browning beast you was

Crawling down the alley on your hands and knees
I'm sure you're not protected
For its plain to see
The diamond dogs are poachers
And they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will
Mannequins with kill-appeal

Will they come?
I keep a friend serene
Will they come?
Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come?
Well, she's come, been, and gone

Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch a death in the fog
Young girl they call them the diamond dogs
Young girl they call them the diamond dogs

Now Halloween jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan chase
The elevators broke so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below
Oh tarzie go man, go

Meets his little hussy with his ghost-town approach
Her face is sans feature but she wears a 
Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent something Mother 
Used to bake
Wrecked up and paralyzed
Diamond dogs are sable-ized

Will they come?
I keep a friend serene
Will they come?
Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come?
Well, she's come, been, and gone

(chorus)

In the year of the scavenger
The season of the bitch
Sashay on the board-walk scurry to the ditch
Just another future song lonely little kitch
There's gonna be sorrow try 
And wake up tomorrow

Will they come?
I keep a friend serene
Will they come?
Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come?
Well, she's come, been, and gone

(chorus)",$$x
